      <p><em>Sociologist by heart | Software Dev by code | Cultural Detective by day | Urban Explorer by night</em></p>
      <p>Welcome to my digital lab, where sociology meets code and data tells urban stories. Iâ€™m Angel Abundisâ€”a sociologist, developer, and graffiti researcher blending computational social science with AI and data analysis. My work unearths hidden narratives in cities, decoding social networks, graffiti movements, and cultural patterns. Here, youâ€™ll find projects that bridge technology and social research, using computational tools to tackle complex societal challenges.</p>
